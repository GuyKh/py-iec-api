## (Temporary) How to get JWT token?

First, enter www.iec.co.il.

Open DevTools (You can use Option + âŒ˜ + J (on macOS), or Shift + CTRL + J (on Windows/Linux)).

Go to Network tab, and filter by `customer`

Login with your ID and go through the SMS OTP token.

When you'll see the GET request to `customer` endpoint, open the `headers` tab and copy the `Authorization` header without the word **Bearer**

This is your token

## Module Usage

```python
    try:
        client = IecApiClient("123456789")
        # client.login() - (Still not working)
        token = input("Input bearer token: ") # you have to override the JWT token manually for now 
        client.override_token(token)
        customer = client.get_customer()
        print(customer)

        contracts = client.get_contracts()
        for contract in contracts:
            print(contract)

        reading = client.get_last_meter_reading(customer.bp_number, contracts[0].contract_id)
        print(reading)
    except IECLoginError as err:
        logger.error("Failed Login: (Code %d): %s", err.code, err.error)
```
